here we use bootstrap because it automatically induces dynamic ability in webpage

Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as grid tiers, for building responsively. These breakpoints can be customized if youâ€™re using our source Sass files. xsmall, small,medium etc

Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system

.container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
.container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints
.container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint
